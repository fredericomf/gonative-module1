# FIRST REACT-NATIVE PROJECT - MODULE 1

## Initial instructions

1. Read and follow the steps described on top level directory.

2. To create a react native new project run:

```bash
$ react-native init [NAME OF PROJECT]
```

### Point of attention

When a native library is linked to project, we must to run, again, "react-native run-android". Otherwise the project runs with: "react-native start"

Generally link library command is like this: "react-native link ..."

### RESETING CACHE

Sometimes, when a red message rose up in device, is necessary to reset our cache running the following command:

```bash
react-native start --reset-cache
```

*NOTICE: This command result a long time to deploy(almost the same of the first time)*
